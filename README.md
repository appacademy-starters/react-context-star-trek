# Star Trek Project

In this project, you will make enhancements to an online trading card 
application. This application allows a user to select cards to build a deck for
game play or trading in the future.

The original developers set up the navigation (using `react-router-dom`) and
created the two primary screen layouts (using function components). Now, they 
need your help with capturing, storing and displaying the user's selection in 
their deck.

To begin

* Install the packages (`npm install`)
* Run the application and explore what's there (`npm start`)
** Notice that nothing happens when you click "buy" buttons on the home page
** See that the sample "friend" deck has cards, but the user's desk does not
** These are the gaps you will close!
* Commit this version before you make changes to a *GitHub* repo in your account
* Look through the code at the components, including UI and react-router setup

In particular, you should be looking for functionality gaps, such as the `const`
definitions at the start of several of the components. Write these down as 
you'll need the information later to provide those values through the context
you create.

> Tip: Test early and often! Use your debugging skills to ensure each change is 
> working before making additional changes. An important skill for software 
> developers is knowing when to ask for assistance!

## Phase 1 - Setup framework

To track the purchases, you'll be using *React Context*. Start by creating a new
function component called `AppContextProvider` and frame out the required pieces
(importing React, the function, and exporting the function).

As you may recall, one of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts is
*encapsulation*, and a good principle to follow is to putting code that changes
for the same reason all together. So, that's the approach you're going to walk
through now. Specifically, this means putting the context and provider together
with the variables shared through the context (a.k.a. `value`), as well as the 
functions that update these variables.

### Define the *context* and its *provider*

Create a folder in `src` called `context`. Inside of the `context` folder,
create a file called `AppContext.js`. In this file, define the following
function component.

The props of the function will include one variable named `children`. This 
variable is built into *React*. It holds a collection of JSX content passed to
the component between its opening and closing tags (which you'll do in the App 
in just a moment). In case you forgot, the easiest way to define your function 
with named props is using deconstruction of the props object into its individual
attributes. In other words, `const AppContextProvider = ({children}) => {`.

Above the function (and outside of it), declare a new constant (e.g. 
`AppContext`) which creates the context. Export this constant. (Later, you'll 
connect hooks to it in the UI components.)

Inside the function, return the provider for the context you created, and 
between the opening and closing JSX tags, place the children. For example:

```javascript
return (
  <AppContext.Provider>
    {children}
  </AppContext.Provider>
);
```

### Include one variable in the `value` as a starting point

Finally (for the moment), set the `value` prop on the component to an object.
In this object, you can start with only the `cards` array. The original 
developers left you *mock data* to use for this purpose, so you can  `import` 
the appropriate constant from the class in `mockdata`.

In case you're stuck, here are a few hints...

```javascript
import { initialCards } from "../mockdata/CardData";

// component function and other stuff

return (
  <AppContext.Provider value={{
    cards: initialCards
  }}>
    {children}
  </AppContext.Provider>
);
```

### Wrap the application in the *provider*

Open _App.js_. Import the new provider you just made. Place it in the
application  such that all components that need to use the context are wrapped
inside of it. In other words, those components are children (or grandchildren,
etc.) of the context provider.

> Tip: This is a good time to commit an update to `git` and push up to *GitHub*.

## Phase 2 - Adding values the *context provider*

Look back at the notes you took while you were reviewing the application. Which
variables did you find that were incomplete in the components?

Hopefully, your list matches this one:

* cards
* decks
* inventory
* buyCard

If your notes do not include details on the variable type and structure of each
of these, please review the components again to gather this information. Take
your time! Being thorough now will save you time and effort and reduce your 
frustration later.

Now, think through each variable and determine which ones change together all or 
most of the time. When working with global context, it is important to keep the
number of state variables to a minimum. Updating 3 variables can cause 3 
rerenders of ALL children, whether or not they use the context.

> Hint: The previous developers informed you that when a card is bought, it will
> be put into the user's deck, and removed from the inventory (meaning the count
> gets reduced).

### Connecting *state* variable(s) to the *context provider*

Back in _AppContextProvider_, you can create a state variable (using the 
`useState` hook) to hold the decks and the inventory (e.g. `applicationState`). 
The initial values you should get from the mock data (which could someday be 
replaced with fetch calls to a backend API, but that is beyond the scope of this
project).

Since the components want to access the `decks` and `inventory` variables 
separately, you'll want to use composition to incorporate them into the `value`
of the context provider.

```javascript
<AppContext.Provider value={{
  ...applicationState,
  cards: initialCards,
}}>
```

### Including a function variable in the *context provider*

The fourth variable that needs to go in the `value` of the *context* is the 
`buyCard` function. In order to reduce the number of rerenders, you'll want to
utilize the `useCallback` hook when defining this function (e.g. 
`buyCardForPlayer`).

In your analysis, you may have noticed the function takes 1 argument - the 
`cardId` - so be sure to include it.

For the dependencies of `useCallback`, you'll want to include the state variable
you made (e.g. `applicationState`), since the function will need to take values
out of it in order to update them.

For now, it's okay to do the equivalent of "nothing" inside the function. If you 
would like to clean up any React warnings (like the function associated with the
`useState` hook being defined, but not used), then you can call the state 
function passing in the state variable (e.g. 
`updateApplicationState(applicationState)`). You may also want to include a
`console.log` statement, so you can easily tell when this is being called 
(which is it NOT yet, but will be very soon).

The last step here is to add the function to the `value` of the *context 
provider*.

```javascript
    <AppContext.Provider value={{
      ...applicationState,
      cards: initialCards,
      buyCard: buyCardForPlayer,
    }}>
```

There's nothing new to test, but it's always a good idea to save and make sure
there are no errors or warnings in the browser console.

## Phase 3 - Buy cards

Now, you can start using your context! Begin in the _Store_ component by 
importing the context you created and the `useContext` hook. Then, replace the 
`buyCard` constant with a deconstructed object that utilizes the `useContext` 
hook.

```javascript
const { buyCard } = useContext(AppContext);
```

When you test in the browser, you should be able to see the output from the 
`console.log` you added to the function in `AppContextProvider`.

### Updating inventory count

Finally, it's time to get into the heart of the algorithm which modifies the 
data (`value`) in the *context*.

FYI, much of the time, *React* development goes this way. You begin by setting 
up JSX for the user interface (which other developers did for you on this 
project!), then add hooks for state, context, and so on. At some point you will 
find you need to write "classic" JavaScript to implement data updates, business 
logic, or other feature functionality. This mix of different kinds of work is 
what attracts many front-end developers to *React*. You are blessed to be 
learning both backend and frontend, so you'll have many choices for your 
career path!

Before you get too deep into the code for updating the state, you may want to 
set up some debugging to make it easier to verify that your code is working as
expected. A `useEffect` hook is particularly useful in this situation.

Since you have to pick some place to start, it might as well be the inventory.
Place any and all `useEffect` calls outside of any functions (probably between 
the function definition you added in phase 2, and the `return` of the context
provider).

```javascript
  // Useful for debugging inventory updates
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("INVENTORY UPDATED", applicationState.inventory)
  }, [applicationState.inventory]);
```

Now, inside the body of the function, add code for the following features

* Don't allow the inventory to go below zero
* Make a copy of the current inventory object
** This is an important approach because updating the current value could cause
   unanticipated re-renders!
* Decrement the inventory value for the card that was clicked
* Modify the call to the state objects update function to provide a new object
  that has the new inventory (while leaving the decks unchanged).

Here's a bit of a hint on that last one...

```javascript
updateApplicationState({
  decks: applicationState.decks,
  inventory: newInventory,
});
```

When you run and test this in the browser, be sure to click the same card enough
times to drive the value to zero, so you can verify the first bullet above is 
covered.

### Show updated inventory in the store

Jump back to the _Store_ component to replace both `inventory` and `cards`
constants with the ones from the context. Don't worry if you find this quite
simple; that just means you're probably doing it right!

Test in the browser and verify the inventory numbers change correctly, and do 
NOT go below zero. Also, check for warnings (like unused imports), and address
those as appropriate (deleting the unused imports).

> Tip: Once you are seeing both the inventory updating properly, you know it's 
> a good time to commit an update to `git` and push up to *GitHub*.

## Phase 4 - Display player's deck

Now, you can work on the player's deck. Remember, that's the first one in the
`desks` array.

If you'd like, you can connect the UI components to the context as the first
step. That means edits in both _Navbar_ and _Deck_.

You shouldn't see any visible changes since the default values are the same and
nothing is updating the decks after initialization. Nonetheless, verifying there
are no code errors is valuable.

### Updating player's deck

The exact implementation is left up to you. You're an experienced developer who
will be able to figure this out. Here's one approach to help get you started if 
you get stuck.

* Add a `useEffect` for logging updates to the decks (similar to the inventory 
  one above)
* Split up decks, knowing the player's one is always first, and all the other
  decks follow
* Make a copy of the player deck (since you'll want to update it next)
* Find the card object in the cards list
** Tip: You can make a constant for this at the beginning of your function
   component (set to `initialCards`, for now). This will allow you to set it 
   as a dependency of the `useCallback`, as well as clean up the first `value`
   you set. While it doesn't affect this particular project, the right thing to
   do is imagine you will soon be switching the mock data to real data from a
   backend service.
* Merge the new card into a copy of the list of cards in the player's deck
* Store the new card list back in their deck
* Modify the object sent to the state update function, to recombine the 
  player's desk with the other decks

At any point along the way, you can and should test and use your debugging 
skills to solve any challenges. As you've probably heard by now, this is a key
skill and common practice in development.

> Tip: You'll definitely want to commit an update to `git` and push up to 
> *GitHub* once all the pieces are working.

Congratulations! You finished the core features of this project!

## Bonus A

There is at least one cool enhancement you can make to your implementation.
Specifically, name your own hook!

The short explanation is that you'll move the use of `useContext` into the class
file with your context provider. Here are the detailed steps.

Edit _AppContextProvider_.

* Remove `export` from the constant for the context
  `const AppContext = React.createContext({});`
* Immediately following, make a new, exported constant with the custom name
  for your hook. Generally, hooks start with the `use` prefix.
  `export const useAppContext = () => useContext(AppContext);`
* Go to the components and replace useContext with your custom hook, e.g.
  `const { decks } = useAppContext();`

*Important Note*

You'll need to declare custom hook as a function so that it runs inside each 
component which uses it. If you forget this, you'll get an error that starts
something like this:

```plaintext
Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a 
function component.
```

## Bonus B

You've probably noticed that when the browser refreshes, all the cards in the
player's deck return to the store. If you'd like them to be persisted, then you
can use `LocalStorage` to save and restore.

Remember to use the mock data for the initial state when the local storage is 
not present (yet). You can reset the local storage in *Chrome dev tools* on the
"Application" tab under "Local Storage" on the left.

> Hint: All of this can be done within AppContextProvider.

## Bonus C

If you implemented `LocalStorage`, you'll soon be wanting a way to return cards
to the store - otherwise known as deleting them from the player's deck. Go ahead
and implement this now.

> Hint: A new function in the context may prove to be useful.
